# Currency calculator app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is currency converter app developed using Flutter for Android, IOS and Web. The app data is extracted using the API provider Nomics.com
I learned about Cupertino Widgets like (Cupertino scaffold, Cupertino picker), displaying platform-specific widgets, deep dive into dart loops, completed the boss level challenge of the course that was to extract 2 more coin data into the same page, and at the same time.
